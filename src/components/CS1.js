    <p className='page3_info_Description'> 
      That time (Before the COVID-19 pandemic), many government offices restricted internet access for various reasons. allso the dont want to reset users passowrd by admin due to privacy issue. To address the challenge of resetting passwords using OTPs in such environments, I designed a functionality. When a user clicks the "Forgot Password" option on a machine without internet access, the system generates and displays a QR code. This QR code contains a link with encrypted data. The user scans the QR code using an internet-enabled mobile device, which redirects the encrypted data to the server. The server processes the request and sends the OTP to the user's registered mobile number. The user then enters the received OTP into their machine. The machine verifies the OTP using pre-encrypted calculations, ensuring secure and seamless password recovery without requiring direct internet access on the userâ€™s machine.

  <p className='page3_info_Description'> 
  The application requires an inward entry for processing outward tasks. When an outward task is marked as complete, it relies on the corresponding inward entry. Using this approach, we can calculate the percentage of completion. In <span class="page3_BodyText_Highlight"> most cases (around 80% - 90%), this workflow operates as expected</span>. However, there are some exceptions where the are doing manual work becuase system not addressing it directly.
  </p>
  <p className='page3_info_Description'>
Outward Without Inward:
In some cases, there is only an outward entry because the letter is generated directly by the office, and no inward entry exists for it. In such cases, the system does not have an inward entry to associate with the outward task, which creates inconsistencies.
</p>
<p className='page3_info_Description'> 
Inward Without Outward:
There are cases where an inward entry exists, but no outward task is required. These entries remain marked as "pending" indefinitely, which increases the pendency count, even though there is no actual pending task.
</p>
<p className='page3_info_Description'>
Inward with Multiple Outwards:
Some inward entries require multiple outward tasks. However, the system currently marks the inward as "completed" after a single outward task is completed, even though additional outward tasks may still be pending.

Changes were found in the locally hosted files that differed from the original ones, leading to significant security and safety issues in the tampered systems. Backdated entries were discovered, caused by someone changing the server date. Additionally, several issues were identified that directly impacted data integrity and found unexpected changes.

        From the implementation of Phase 1, we found many advantages, but there are still some ongoing challenges. Our main goal for Phase 2 is to connect all offices and establish a communication bridge between them to reduce communication time. Additionally, departments within the same hierarchy should have real-time access to status updates. For example, officers in the Chief Minister's office will be able to know the status of activities at the taluka level with a simple click.
