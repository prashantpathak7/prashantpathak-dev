    <p>ðŸ“Œ Reset Password Using OTP Without Internet Access on the User's Computer
    </p>
    <p className='page3_info_Description'> 
      That time (Before the COVID-19 pandemic), many government offices restricted internet access for various reasons. To address the challenge of resetting passwords using OTPs in such environments, I designed a functionality. When a user clicks the "Forgot Password" option on a machine without internet access, the system generates and displays a QR code. This QR code contains a link with encrypted data. The user scans the QR code using an internet-enabled mobile device, which redirects the encrypted data to the server. The server processes the request and sends the OTP to the user's registered mobile number. The user then enters the received OTP into their machine. The machine verifies the OTP using pre-encrypted calculations, ensuring secure and seamless password recovery without requiring direct internet access on the userâ€™s machine.
